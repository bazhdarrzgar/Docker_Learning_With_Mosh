## What is docker: docker is platform that provide holding your project with this dependence without installing in new machine or setting up the configuration for it.

* Problem Before : 

    - you should have the same version of the ( tool or package or library or ..) that need install it in the machine + this configuration in the setting that need to manage before running the application.

    - More ( Hardware or Software )  in your computer cause performance or diffecalty to run your system and it should be start your application every time before running your project ( slow expernis ) come here for the user.

    - you may need to run other project that have dependent on other ( version of other tool or package ) and also you may be have problem that your other project with different dependent and version ( of this software or tool or package or library ) but this new project or this project in github have different version of previous ( package or library or..) this is problem because your computer have different version of this library or software that you need to done this work.

* Solution : 

    - docker come here to manage all this by:

    - less hardware depende it can run multiple more than 100 handred container and image in the same time without a lot of performance.

    - each container or image run in difference way and different tool and library and .. without interact with each other to make problem to each other. 
    
    - the version you need for each library or â€¦ will install for specific image or container this is the best.
